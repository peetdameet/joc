    <div class="desc">This is an image of a popular game on the next generation Xbox consoles. This game has backward compatibility, meaning that it can run on older platforms, but it really excels on the newer consoles. With enhanced graphics capabilities and more processing power for terrain and raytracing, this game looks hyper-realistic.</div>

    <div class="desc">This image is simply the Xbox Series X. This is the 'better' of the two new xboxes, having increased storage and some extra processing capabilities. With console gaming, storage is very important as games can take up increasingly excessive amounts of space, and the extra storage provided by the series X makes up for that. Additionaly, many like the sleek, black look of it although the design is extremely simplistic.</div>

    <div class="desc">This is Sony's newest console. This console is nearly the same, if not better than both of the newer Xbox series' consoles. This also has exclusive high-resolution games like Forza. The playstation 5 offers much more than the previous playstation 4, which is why sales for this console happen within days of new factory releases of them.</div>

    <div class="desc"> This game can be played on any console, but it runs extremely smoothly on the next generation consoles. I included this game because it is cross-platform, and I personally think that every game should be cross-platform like Rocket League. This game also has a very high 'skill ceiling', and so players on better consoles will have a more refined gaming experience.</div>

  <p>This example use media queries to re-arrange the images on different screen sizes: for screens larger than 700px wide, it will show four images side by side, for screens smaller than 700px, it will show two images side by side. For screens smaller than 500px, the images will stack vertically (100%).</p>
